# Tab Counter

A simple extension to see how many tabs you have open.  
I didn't trust the ones on the Chrome Web Store, and figuredâ€”why use one from the store when I can build my own?

## Features

- Shows the number of open tabs in the popup
- Displays the tab count as a badge on the extension icon

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser.
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right).
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select this project folder.

## Usage

- Click the extension icon to see the number of open tabs.
- The badge on the icon also shows the current tab count.
